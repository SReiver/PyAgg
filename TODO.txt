TO DO

fix inverse transform pixel2coord

x/y data lengths by converting to pixels




FUTURE

support wrapping text in textbox, with or without box fill and outline

allow multiple text sizes incl percent (not just points)

allow draw svg, using svgfig module to load them




MAYBE

have each draw op return shape obj that have coords, bounding box, center, and compass directions for placement. 

support drawing lineoutline, by manual calculating line offsets and intersections based on left or right turn (see pydraw)

allow basic gradients

maybe draw circle and square should have fillsize as custom arg instead of part of **kwoptions, but maybe not

mac error view() shows nothing if background set to none
