TO DO

allow draw svg, using svgfig module to load them

for shapes that need filling (circle, box, line, pie), when using irregular transform find way to draw them without distorting their shapes (eg draw to a new image without setting a transform and using coords2pixel, then merge images (OR just removing the transform temporarily and then reapplying after drawing) )

decide if sizes should use coordinate system units (slower bc has to convert) or pixel units (faster but maybe inconvenient) or if possible to choose bw both for each draw operation via a "units" arg.



MAYBE

support wrapping text in textbox, with or without box fill and outline

support drawing lineoutline, by manual calculating line offsets and intersections based on left or right turn (see pydraw)

maybe draw circle and square should have fillsize as custom arg instead of part of **kwoptions, but maybe not
