- Style your drawing sizes and distances in several types of units, including pixels, percentagea, cm, mm, inches, and
font points, by specifying the real world size of your image.
- Smart support for text writing, including text anchoring, and automatic detection of available fonts. 
- Instantly view your image in a Tkinter pop up window, or prepare it for use in a Tkinter application. 

There is also support for common domain specific data visualization:

- Partial support for geographical plotting, including a lat/long coordinate system, and automatic drawing of
GeoJSON features. 
- Easily plot statistical data on graphs witn a syntax and functionality that is aimed more for data analysts and laymen than
computer scientists, including linegraph, scatterplot, histogram, etc, although these are still a work in progress.
